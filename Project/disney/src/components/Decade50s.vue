                  <h5 class="mt-0">1950 - Cinderella</h5>
                  <p>After the series of net losses created by the end of the 40s era of Disney, morale was low. This was amplified by the loss of audience in the European section of viewers, due to the Second World War. Thus, Disney needed a big project that would create revenue for the almost bankrupt company.</p>
                  <br><p>In 1950 Disney released <span class="italic">Cinderella</span>, based on the europpean folk tale with the same name, that tells the story of a young woman oppressed by her family. Cinderella, a beautiful young woman lived with her cruel stepmother and stepsisters in a big chateau and worked for them as a maid, under poor conditions. The stepmother is envious of Cinderella's beauty and unfairly keeps under such conditions because of this. Meanwhile the King of the realm is frustrated with his son, the Prince, since he refuses to marry a girl while there being many that fit the King's standards and liking. To help this cause a big ball is organized with open invitation to any young unmarried girl. Upon hearing this Cinderella convinces her stepmother to go, under the conditions that she finishes all her chores and can find a good dress to wear to the ball. Cinderella, with the help of her animal companions that follow her around the house finds a gown that once belonged to her mother along with accessories that her stepsisters threw away. She gets ready for the ball but when she meets the stepmother and sisters they realise how beautiful she looks and who the accessories belong to, thus tearing the dress to pieces and giving her more chores. Cinderella breaks out in tears and a magical Godmother appears, transforming a pumpkin into a carriage and giving her a white dress and glass slippers. She leaves for the ball alone, but is warned that she must leave before midnight, for this spell and the outfit will be gone by then. Upon reaching the ball, the Prince invites her to a dance and Cinderella accepts, despite not knowing who he is. The two quickly fall in love and dance, but as they are about to kiss she notices on the clock that midnight is almost about to strike and thus must quickly leave the venue, which she does, leaving a single glass slipper on the stairs by accident. The next day the King issues an order to every girl that she must try the slipper on for size and Cinderella's stepmother realizes that her stepdaughter is the one who lost the slipper thus sabotaging her every attempt at reaching the Prince. With the help of her companions Cinderella succeeds in reaching the Prince, but the stepmother breaks the slipper to sabotage her once again. Nevertheless Cinderella shows the other glass slipper and shows that she is the perfect match. The two get married and live happily ever after.</p>
                  <br><p>The movie scored a tremendous success with audiences and generated a generous profit for the company. It also won various awards for the soundtrack, which included songs mentioned even today. It is now considered one of the most important pieces of animation in history.</p>

                  <h5 class="mt-0">1953 - Peter Pan</h5>
                  <p>In 1953 Disney invests on a big movie project, <span class="italic">Peter Pan</span>, an animated fantasy film much like the previous famous ones of the decade. It is based on a 20th century Scottish novel with the same name. Disney decided to reuse the cast from <span class="italic">Alice in Wonderland</span>, due to their good performances in the latter.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>The movie starts with introducing a group of children telling the tale of Peter Pan and the pirates. That night they are visited by Peter Pan himself, who teaches the children to fly along the pixie Tinker Bell and takes them to the Never Land. Upon reaching the island, Tinker Bell who is jealous of Wendy and the attention Peter Pan gives her, tells the Lost Boys (Peter Pan's crew) that he has ordered them to shoot down Wendy. Peter later finds about this betrayal, and banishes Tinker Bell. The Boys reach into the island and are trapped by its Indians, who think they are behind the capture of the chief's daughter. Meanwhile, Peter Pan takes Wendy with him and they go see the mermaids who mischieviously like tormenting Wendy and find out that Captain Hook, the leader of the island's pirates, is the one behind the kidnapping of the chief's daughter. Peter and Wendy free the girl and Peter is greeted with rejoicing by the tribe. Hook and Tinker Bell conspire together and Hook convices Tinker to reveal Peter Pan's lair. Meanwhile Wendy convices the Lost Boys to return to London, which makes Peter furious, since he refuses to grow up. Hook and the pirates successfully ambush the Boys and leave a bomb to kill Peter, which Tinker Bell disarms when she discovers that they are trying to kill him. Peter and Hook engage in fighting as the Boys fight off the crew before walking the plank. They succeed and fly off to London, where the Lost Boys go back in their decision and decide to go to the Never Land again. Wendy and George stay in London where they tell their stories to the other children.</p>

                  <p>In 1955 Disney premiers a romantic comedy-drama called <span class="italic">The Lady and the Tramp</span>, a movie about the romance between two dogs. The plot of the movie is based around an american novel.</p>
                  <p>Lady is an American Cocker Spaniel born into an upper-class family who enjoys a happy dog life with the other neighborhood dogs, Jack and Trusty. Tramp is a stray mongrel that lives alone and digs for scraps around the streets, especially on the backstreet of Tony's Italian Restaurant, and hangs out with other stray dogs, while managing to protect the pack from the local dogcatcher. One day, Lady notices that her owners started treating her coldly, and has a conversation about it with her friends, which Tramp interrupts. Jack and Trusty start disliking Tramp because of this. They realise that the cold manner that Lady's owners are treating her is due to the soon-to-be new baby that the family is going to be having, and when the baby does arrive, they introduce it to Lady who grows fond of the child. The house cats start being mischievious and trick her owners into thinking Lady attacked the baby, so they get her a muzzle. Lady then flees the house and is pursued by stray dogs, and Tramp comes to her rescue and finds a beaver that can remove Lady's muzzle. The night eventually leads them to Tony's, where they share a (rather iconic) candle-lit dinner. The two fall in love, but she chooses to return home to watch over the infant. However, when Tramp is escorting her back, Lady is captured by the dogcatcher, and is brought to the neighborhood dog pound. She finds there that Tramp had had previous girlfriends and this leaves on her a bitter taste. Lady's owners come to pick her up and chain her in the backyard as punishment for fleeing. When Tramp arrives to apologize, Lady treats him coldly, and confronts him about his previous girlfriends. When he apologizes, a rat sneaks into the house, making the dogs bark at it to scare it away, but Lady's owner tells her to be quiet. Tramp decides to set into the house to kill the house and kills the rat, but when doing so he knocks over the child's crib, which makes Lady's owner think that the dogs are trying to harm the baby. She locks Tramp down to have him taken away. When the dogcatcher comes, Lady's friends come as well and she explains to them the situation. Jack and Trusty then chase the catcher's wagon, and cause it to crash. Tramp is released and reunited with Lady. Tramp is then adopted into the family and they start their own family.</p>

                  <p>Disney premiers in 1959 the 75 minute long movie <span class="italic"> Sleeping Beauty </span>. This was Disney's last fairy tale animation for some decades, only returning to the genre later into the century. The movie underperformed in reception but is now acclaimed as one of the best fairy tale animation movies of all time.</p>
                  <p>Upon the birth of Pricess Aurora, a holiday is proclaimed in the realm and guests are invited to the castle. Among the guests, the fairies Flora, Fauna and Merryweather come to bless the child with gifts and song but when Merryweather goes up to give her blessing the evil Malificent appears, despite not being invited. She then curses the princess because of this insult, proclaiming that the child will grow well but when she reaches sixteen years of age she will use her finger to use the spindle of a spinning wheel and will die. Merryweather then softens the curse, removing the effect of death and stating that she will only fall into deep slumber which can be broken by true love's kiss. The fairies fear for the princess and take her to a cottage until her sixteenth birthday arrives. The movie then cuts into a grown Aurora, singing songs with the woodland's animals. By singing she attracts the attention of the Prince Philip, and he quickly takes a liking to her. She, however is frightened by the stranger, as she is not allowed to talk to them, but they start talking and soon after fall in love. Meanwhile Malificent finds out about the princess' whereabouts. Aurora tells the fairies about the stranger and they tell her the truth of her heritage and forbid her to talk to him again, which leaves her heartbroken. The next night Malificent appears to Aurora and convinces her to touch the spinning wheel, leaving her in slumber. The fairies lock the princess in a tower and cast a spell that leaves the whole kingdom asleep until true love's kiss hits the princess' lips. Philip is kidnapped by Malificent, who is freed by the fairies and armed with a powerful sword. Malificent turns into a dragon and Philip fights her off, throwing the blade into her heart, killing her. Philip awakens Aurora breaking the spell on her and the kingdom, and they are married and live happily ever after.</p>
