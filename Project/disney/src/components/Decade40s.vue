                  <h5 class="mt-0">1940 - Pinocchio</h5>
                  <p>Based on an old Italian fairytale for children, Disney produces <span class="italic">Pinocchio</span>, a 88 minute long feature movie that marked a significant advancement in technology in the special effects area.</p>
                  <p>The movie portrays the story of an old man called Geppetto and his wood-carved puppet called Pinocchio. Visited by a magical blue fairy, Pinocchio is told that he can become a real boy if he is truthful and unselfish. Through a series of encounters with characters decided to lead Pinocchio astray, leading to be trapped in a cage. Although his companion, the famous Jiminy Cricket urges him to tell the fairy everything that happened, Pinocchio starts lying which causes his nose to grow longer and longer. Despite this, the fairy makes him promise to be a good boy again. On the way home, Pinocchio encounters a series of unfortunate characters that once again lead him to bad actions such as vandalism, gambling, and such. They convince him to go the Pleasure Island, on which he is half-turned into a donkey, like everyone that ends up there. He manages to escape but finds out that Geppetto has been trapped inside a giant sperm whale. Pinocchio sets out to reunite with him and help rescue him, alongside Jiminy and the fairy. He succeeds in rescuing his creator, but dies in the process. Nevertheless, the fairy decides that Pinocchio has been good enough to bring him back as a real boy, ending the story on a happy ending.</p>
                  <p>Despite growing to become quite a success and later received several academy awards, <span class="italic">Pinocchio</span> was initially a box-office disaster.</p>

                  <p>Disney releases <span class="italic">Fantasia</span>, in an effort to recover from financial losses from <span class="italic">Pinocchio</span>, and marking the first feature film to star Mickey Mouse. The movie initally set out to be displayed alongside a massive fair and music piece, which was a big investment for the company, thus resulting in losses. The movie reached universal acclaim and is now considered one of the best made animation movies of all time.</p>

                  <h5 class="mt-0">1941 - Dumbo</h5>
                  <p>The fourth animated feature film produced by Disney, <span class="italic">Dumbo</span>, premiers in 1941 as an effort to spread positive morale during the Second World War to the United States. The movie sets around an elephant, nicknamed Dumbo (for Dumb) and his best friend the mouse Timothy, who he meets after his mother is kept in a cage and he is left alone, much to his demise. Timothy makes an effort to help Dumbo regain his strength and encourages him in the circus' stunts. Despite this, Dumbo proves himself clumsy and trips over a pyramid stunt during a circus act, which further damages his relationship with the other circus elephants. Because of this he is appointed clown and regains fame although not among the other elephants, which no longer consider him as one of their own. With such isolation and mockery, he becomes sadder and sadder, and decides to visit his mother and on the way back he accidentally drinks from a bucket from which Timothy drinks as well. They did not know but the bucket contained alchohol, and thus they become drunk and start having visual hallucinations (including the famous <span class="italic">Pink Elephants On Parade</span> music act). After this Dumbo and Timothy find themselves trapped on a tree, and Timothy encourages Dumbo to fly down with his ears. Later he performs his usual circus act but decides to fly down, which gains him an enormous crowd reaction and popularity, ending the movie on a goodbye scene between him and his mother.</p>
                  <p>The movie reaches tremendous success, despite being quite short at around 63 minutes, and nets Disney big profits unlike the previous feature films.</p>

                  <p>In 1942 Disney premiers Bambi, another feature film. The movie portrays the life of a young deer, Bambi, and his group of friends which includes Thumper, the iconic pink-nosed rabbit who thumps his foot when he's excited. The movie is based on a children's book.</p>
                  <p>Bambi starts off by learning how to walk a speak, much like an infant and starts off surrounded by his group of friends. He meets the young skunk Flower and the fawn Faline. The movie starts off slow and shows his growth, while becoming attached to his mother. The forest is then tormented by the Man (a group of hunters), that cause the fauna to run and try to get to safety. Thus Bambi and Thumper get separated from Bambi's mother, but are reunited again shortly after that. A big winter comes and one day Man comes again, and this time he succeeds in killing Bambi's mother. The next big portion of the movie shows Bambi's and Thumper's growth, and discovery of romantic counterparts, during which Bambi finds himself at a conflict with an older stag. Bambi succeeds in defeating this older stag and thus earns the right to courtship. Some time after, they find the Man again, whose dogs surround Faline but Bambi manages to scare them off. The movie ends on a happy ending, as Faline births offspring and Bambi is the Great Prince of the Forest.</p>
                  <p><span class="italic">Bambi</span> reaches universal acclaim later on but upon reception it was greeted with very mixed reviews, as american hunters spoke out against the movie.</p>
