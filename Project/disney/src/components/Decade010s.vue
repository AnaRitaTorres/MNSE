                    Hiro Hamada is a 14-year-old robotics genius living in the futuristic city of San Fransokyo who spends much of his free time participating in illegal robot fights.
                    To redirect Hiro, his elder brother Tadashi takes him to the research lab at the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology, where Hiro meets Tadashi's friends,
                    GoGo, Wasabi, Honey Lemon, and Fred. Hiro also meets Professor Robert Callaghan, the head of the university's robotics program. Amazed, Hiro decides to apply to the university.
                    A day when Tadashi is in the lab a fire breaks and kills him. Weeks later, a depressed Hiro inadvertently activates Baymax, the inflatable healthcare robot that Tadashi created.
                    The two go on an adventure and find out someone has been mass producing microbots and are attacked. After that they reunite everyone and create a
                    high-tech superhero team to fight the villain. Even though Hiro convices himself that transforming Baymax in a killing machine, it shows him clips of
                    his older brother showing him vengeance is not the way. They eventually make things right but Baymax is injured in the process and does not resist.
                    Some time later, Hiro discovers Baymax's personality chip clenched in the rocket fist. He rebuilds Baymax's body, and the six friends continue their exploits throughout the city.

                  <p>
                    Riley Andersen is born in Minnesota. Within her mind's Headquarters, five personifications of her basic emotions — Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger —
                    come to life and influence her actions via a control console. As she grows up, her experiences become memories, stored in colored orbs, which are sent into
                    long-term memory each night. Her five most important "core memories" (all happy ones) are housed in a hub; each powers an aspect of her personality which takes
                    the form of floating islands. Joy acts as a de facto leader, and since she and the other emotions do not understand Sadness' purpose, she tries to keep Sadness away from the console.
                    This film explores the emotions of humans and how they affect interpersonal relationships in a fun and complex personification of emotions.

                    Following the Battle of New York, Adrian Toomes and his salvage company are contracted to clean up the city,
                    but their operation is taken over by the Department of Damage Control (D.O.D.C.), a partnership between Tony Stark
                    and the U.S. government. Enraged at being driven out of business, Toomes persuades his employees to keep the Chitauri
                    technology they have already scavenged and use it to create and sell advanced weapons.
                    Parker quits his school's academic decathlon team to spend more time focusing on his crime-fighting activities
                    as Spider-Man. One night, after preventing criminals from robbing an ATM with their advanced weapons from Toomes,
                    Parker returns to his Queens apartment where his best friend Ned discovers his secret identity.
                    As Toomes continues with his activities, Parker finds out and intervenes by himself when Stark finds out helps him save
                    the civilians involved but revokes Peter's access to the suit as form of punishement for his recklessness.
                    Parker returns to his high school life, and eventually asks his crush to go to the homecoming dance with him.
                    On the night of the dance, Parker learns that Toomes is her father.  During the dance, Parker realizes Toomes is
                    planning to hijack a D.O.D.C. plane transporting weapons from Avengers Tower to the team's new headquarters,
                    dons his old homemade Spider-Man suit and races to Toomes' lair.
                    At the lair, Toomes destroys the building's support beams and leaves Parker to die, but he escapes.
                    In the end, Peter Parker declines an invitation from Stark to join the Avengers full-time and Tony returns his suit.

                   T'Challa, the King of Wakanda, rises to the throne in the isolated, technologically advanced African nation,
                   but his claim is challenged by a vengeful outsider who was a childhood victim of T'Challa's father's mistake, Erik Killmonger.
                   Killmonger challenges T'Challa to ritual combat defeats T'Challa and hurls him over a waterfall,
                   where he is presumed dead. Killmonger ingests the heart-shaped herb and orders the rest incinerated,
                   but Nakia, T'Challa's ex-lover, extracts one first. Killmonger, supported by W'Kabi and his army,
                   prepares to distribute shipments of Wakandan weapons to operatives around the world.
                   T'Challas's mother and sister find a comatose T'Challa who is saved by the herb Nakia kept. After he regains his strength, he returns
                   to fight Killmonger. Fighting in Wakanda's vibranium mine, T'Challa disrupts Killmonger's suit and stabs him. Killmonger refuses to be healed,
                   choosing to die a free man rather than be incarcerated.
                   In a mid-credits scene, T'Challa appears before the United Nations to reveal Wakanda's true nature to the world.
