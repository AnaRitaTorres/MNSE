They escort the litter and the other puppies back to London where they are chased by the villains, where they manage to throw the cart off the path and into a ravine, defeating the bad guys at last. Back in London they celebrate Christmas and rejoice with the new puppies.</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>Disney creates <span class="italic">The Sword in the Stone</span>, an animated musical comedy based on a novel with the same name. The movie was a box office success.</p>
                  <p>The movie tells a story that begins with a prophecy, a sword set in stone that only the rightful king of England could ever retrive. No one could remove this sword, thus leaving England in a Dark Age. Meanwhile we are introduced with Arthur, an orphan who accidentally meets Merlin, a wizard. The wizard proclaims himself Arthur's tutor and returns him to his home, a castle under Sir Ector. Ector appoints Arthur as his older foster brother Kay's squire. Merlin uses all sorts of magic to educate the boy in various fields of science and empiric knowledge. Ector accuses Merlin of using black magic, and challenges him. Arthur defends the wizard with success and is unappointed squire. Merlin sets out to teach Arthur more and more and when doing so he meets Mim, a black witch. Mim challenges Merlin to a magic duel and he outsmarts her trickery with knowledge. Meanwhile Kay is knighted but his squire falls into illness, leaving Arthur to the job, which causes fallout between Arthur and Merlin. Arthur mistakenly loses his sword and is conviced by the wizard's owl to retrieve the legendary sword, which he does effortlessly. He is revealed to be England's rightful knight and earns everyone's respect as he is crowned, creating the Knights of the Round Table in the process.</p>
